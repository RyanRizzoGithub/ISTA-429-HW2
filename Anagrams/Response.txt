Data Management  - For this category I choose “Record all the steps used to process data.” Without this information it can be difficult to figure out why data might 
not be processing the way you intend it to. Recording all the steps gives yourself or debuggers the opportunity to find solutions much easier and more efficiently.

Software – For this category I choose “Give functions and variables meaningful  names.” It is very common when developing software to walk always from your code for
long times. If you do not give your variables significant names, you will have to go through the process of relearning the names each time you work.

Collaboration – For the category I choose “Create an overview of your project.” I think this is a step that is crucial in all larger scale collaborations.
Its good to give yourself and your group a good understanding of what work needs to be done, and how it can be delegated.

Project Organization – For this category I choose “Name all files to reflect their content or name.” This practice is very similar to giving functions and
variables proper names. When you are working on a project you don’t want to waste valuable time on file navigation. Good file names and overall good project
management will help prevent this.

Keeping track of changes – For this category I choose “Back up everything created by a human being as soon as it is created. This is important because it
is crucial you never lose work which could have been a breakthrough. Backing up all of your work ensures this is never an issue.
